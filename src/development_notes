For any problem now the code needs both an XML file and a class. The presence of the class is very useful for speeding up the computations, 
however, it should be elective. This can be done by specifying the three following things in the XML file:
1 - Pareto Front (for calculating GD & IGD)
2 - Ideal Point (for HV normalization)
3 - Reference Point (for HV normalization)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Normalizing constraints should be checked (DONE - see the following comment)
The code does not do any constraint normalization. This is the responsibility 
of the user to provide an already constraint-normalized problem to the
algorithms. This is valid for both Himanshu's code (C code) and my code (Java
code).
Note: the welded beam problem is normalized while the pressure vessel is not,
but it is worth noting that the differences in violation magnitudes in the 
pressure vessel problem are not big (from one constraint to the other), while
in the welded beam problem, the differences are huge (so the normalization is
much more important in this case).
