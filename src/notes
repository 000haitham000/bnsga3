* All for 2 objectives:
ZDT 1-2-3-4-6 & DTLZ 1-2-3-4 popsize = 50-(100) (DONE)
Constrained problems: from the book CTP (NOT DONE but replaced with the welded beam and the pressure vessel problem)
WFG problems (NOT DONE)

* Metrics used:
Hyper volume + IGD + GD (DONE and the igd bug is fixed in both NSGA-II and NSGA-III)

* Conference Paper:
Just the bi-objective comparison between NSGA 2 & 3 (DONE)
Present results from both algorithms on Test problems (ZTD 1-4,6+some constrained problems)
Try some basic fixes (ZTD 1,4):
a-Add niching based on reference directions during selection + with the same direction select one point (the better out of two)
b-Add non-domination + niching(the same as previous) during selection
c-Add niching for constrained problems (beside the non-domination that is already there)
c-wrap up with a conclusion & future suggestion

* Plots for the conference paper (pick median runs based on hypervolume):
1-The avg. # of population members per reference direction per each generation for NSGA-III (ZDT-1,4)
2-Number of points in Pt+1 coming from Qt per generation for both algorithms (ZDT-1,4) (use the same initial population)

* Journal Paper:
Add the 1 objective extension (modification: ratio population_size/n_ref_points)
If the ratio is greater than 2 we SURELY need selection, if it is ONE we SURELY do NOT need selection. In between values need more investigation.

Check increasing the ratio up to 1.5 with crowding distance based
