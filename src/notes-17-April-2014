Reference points code has to be changed (it should generate only one reference point)
NSGA3 code should work fine through all its phases with only one reference direction.
Remove duplicates starting from the last front to the first front given that the whole size of the merged population stays >= N(population size)
Constrained: G01, G04, G06
Un-Constrained: Ellipsoidal, Schwefel, Rosenbrock (20 variables) (All F* = 0, use 10^-6 accuracy)

Although it does not take into account the possibility that the first solution
can be infeasible, this is not a problem, because it is only applied on arrays
of feasible solutions.
