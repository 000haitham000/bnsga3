X-NSGA-III might seem to throw an exception in constrained problems, because
tournament selection uses reference directions associations which cannot be
calculated for constraints violating individuals. However this is not a real
problem because X-NSGA-III uses this information only when the two solutions
under investigation are feasible. (needs to be confirmed with real experiments
i.e. runs))
